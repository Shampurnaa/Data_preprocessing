# Data Preprocessing Templates

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook templates for data preprocessing, which are essential steps in any data science and machine learning project. These templates provide a comprehensive guide on how to import, clean, encode, split, and scale datasets.

## Notebooks

### 1. Data_preprocessing_template.ipynb

This notebook covers:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets

### 2. Data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb

This notebook includes:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the dataset
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical data (both independent and dependent variables)
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Feature scaling

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-preprocessing-templates.git
    ```

2. **Open the notebooks:**
    - You can open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Usage

These templates can be used as a starting point for preprocessing your datasets. Simply modify the code to fit the specific requirements of your project.

## Acknowledgments

- The initial templates were automatically generated by Google Colab.

Feel free to customize and expand these notebooks according to your needs. Happy coding!
